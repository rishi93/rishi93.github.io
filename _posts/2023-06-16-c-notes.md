> C is the foundational language of Computer Science.

There are very few features in C, and the syntax is relatively simple.

A program in C consists of only *function definitions* and *structure definitions*.
A source file is simply a list of *functions* and *types*.

The execution of a C program always starts in the function called `main`. From here
it calls more and more functions to perform all the actions it requires.

### Variables, Datatypes
Every variable in C has an explicit type. The declaration is a statement, and we
terminate all statements in C with a semicolon.
```c
int count = 0; // or just int count; (uninitialized)
```

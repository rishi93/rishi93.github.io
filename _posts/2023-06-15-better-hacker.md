better hacker.

It's not about breaking computer systems. But about tinkering with them and getting
a better understanding of them, and to build useful stuff with them.

Take a look at this text by Eric.S.Raymond for the philosophy behind hacking.
[how to become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).


## Things to do:
* Write your own interpreter (Crafting Interpreters book by Bob Nystrom).
* Write your own lisp (build your own lisp book).
* Write your own C compiler (Look at Nora Sandler's book).
* Learn x86 assembly language and architecture.

### Additional things:
These things are more practical than the above list.
* Learn better C programming.
* Learn Haskell and functional programming.

### Similar resources on the internet
There are already some resources on the internet that try to gather all the things
under one place (things that would give one a better understanding of computer
systems).

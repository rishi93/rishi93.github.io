Capital "Ruby" refers to the language specification, and ruby to the ruby command
as an implementation.

It is developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. There is no standard. The specification is
merely shown as an implementation.

* Ruby is an object oriented language. 
* It is a scripting language (what does this even mean?
it means it's easy to quickly type out a script for any task?)
* ruby is an interpreter.
* automatic memory control --> memory is allocated and deallocated automatically
by the system.
* variables in Ruby don't have types --> dynamic typing.
* Everything is an expression. You can write something like this:
```ruby
result = if condition then something else otherthing end
# If condition is true, the result = something
# if condition is false, then result is otherthing
```
Many people feel Ruby is similar to Lisp.
